This is a simple chess game where 2 users play against each other. Users enter coordinates of the piece they would like to move, and then they enter the coordinates of where they want to move the selected piece.

If a user enters a coordinate which contains no piece, or if the user enters a coordinate which contains a piece of a different color, then an error is thrown. Users have the option to restart the game. After a piece is killed/removed, the piece is stored in a container which contains the rest of the killed/removed pieces.

When the user selects a piece, then the possible moves of that given piece are highlighted yellow on the chess board.

If a pawn enters the opposite end of the board, the user is given a set of choices on what the pawn should be promoted to. The choices include Rook, Knight, Queen, and Bishop. During this event, the input area where users are supposed to enter coordinates to select pieces is temporarily removed, as users MUST promote their pawn to one of these choices.

Once a King is killed, a header is displayed on the screen saying that there is a checkmate and the game is over. Once this occurs, the input area is removed. If users decide to restart the game, then the input box will appear once again. 

Important Note: Due to the simple nature of this game, En Passant and Castle functionality is not included.
